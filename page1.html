        <h2>B) Why Anti-Inflammatory Foods Are Important</h2>
        Eating a wide variety of anti-inflammatory foods is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Many of today’s refined foods, such as fast foods, processed meats, alcohol, and sodas, lead to inflammation. Inflammation is your body’s defense system designed to protect your body. When we eat heavily refined foods on a consistent basis, we are putting our defense system on overload, which can damage cells and tissues, potentially leading to various diseases. Try adding anti-inflammatory foods such as these to your meals: berries, salmon, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, tomatoes, cherries, walnuts, almonds, leafy greens, sweet potatoes, avocados, and broccoli<br>
        For those of you who exercise, these foods are also necessary to accelerate your recovery windows and reduce soreness.<br>
         
        <h2>C) Growing Medical Recognition of Yoga as a Treatment for Anxiety</h2>
        Feelings of anxiety can quickly overwhelm us, leading to an automatic reactivity with no gap, filter or interval for response. Through practice, yoga breaks the patterns responsible for this automatic behavior. The meditation practice component of yoga works on improving self-regulation of the attention networks in your brain. As you gain more skill in the interface between your thought processes and emotion control, you simultaneously become more sensitive and less negatively reactive to your own thoughts and life situations.<br>
